# ITO_Qik2020

This repository is for the project titled : Ice-tethered observatory - Qikiqtarjuaq 2020

Project Summary:
In June 2020, a team of locals in Qikiqtarjuaq recovered an ice-tethered observatory (ITO) that was deployed in the sea-ice off Baffin Island in February. The ITO was comprised of three scientific instruments to measure high-resolution temporal patterns in acoustic backscatter below the ice, ambient and downwelled light, and sea-icer thickness and temperature above and below the ice. From these instruments we can infer some patterns about the biological communities of zooplankton and fish below the ice, as well as the environmental factors that may drive their behavior. 

Each individual files in this repository will focus on a single instrument. Additional files for modelling, figures, and text may be added.
